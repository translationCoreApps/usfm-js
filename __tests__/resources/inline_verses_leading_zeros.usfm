\cl Chapter 1
\v 01 Many have tried to set in order a narrative about those matters that have been fulfilled among us, \v 02 just as they handed them to us, who from the beginning have been eyewitnesses and servants of the message. \v 03 So to me also it seemed good—having accurately investigated the course of all these things from the beginning— to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus. \v 04 This is so that you might know the truth about the things that you were taught.
